# Deployment & git safety

<!-- Never give this file `paths:` frontmatter. A path-scoped rule loads only once Claude
     reads a matching file, so these guardrails would be absent from exactly the sessions
     that never open a Salesforce artifact — including the ones that deploy or commit. -->

These guardrails are not optional and hold for every task, including work done by dispatched agents:

- **Never run `git commit`, `git push`, or any variant** (amend, force-push, rebase, tag push)
  unless commits are explicitly granted — do not infer from context or plan approval. The one
  exception is **checkpoint mode**, granted either in the current message (e.g. *"checkpoint as you
  go"*) or at planning time via `sf-plan`'s checkpoint question, recorded as
  `Checkpoint commits: enabled` in `docs/CONTEXT.md`. Under it the **main agent** commits at stable
  points — including each work item as it passes review, which land on the **current working branch**
  so a handover can reference them by hash; throwaway rollback checkpoints may instead use a
  dedicated `checkpoint/<task-slug>` branch (full rule: `docs/ORCHESTRATION.md`). Plan approval alone
  is **not** a grant (approving the plan ≠ answering the checkpoint question), **subagents never
  commit**, and the grant expires when the task completes.
- **Never deploy to a Salesforce org without explicit user approval.** Confirm the target org alias
  and manifest path first, and if the deploy includes destructive members, show the affected
  components and get explicit confirmation. You may run `sf project deploy validate` freely to
  support test-driven development — only the actual deploy needs approval.
- **No secrets.** Never put org credentials, session IDs, access tokens, or real customer data in
  code, tests, logs, or generated files.
